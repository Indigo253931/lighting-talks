	1. What problem does this technology solve?

		Three.js allows front-end developers to take the UX/UI of their apps and projects to a whole new level of creativity. 

							-Features-

			Anaglyph, cross-eyed and parallax barrier.

			Scenes: add and remove objects at run-time; fog

			Cameras: perspective and orthographic; 

			Controllers: trackball, FPS, path and more

			Animation: armatures, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, morph and keyframe

			Lights: ambient, direction, point and spot lights; shadows: cast and receive

			Materials: Lambert, Phong, smooth shading, textures and more

			Shaders: access to full OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) 

			Capabilities: lens flare, depth pass and extensive post-processing library

			Objects: meshes, particles, sprites, lines, ribbons, bones and more - all with Level of detail

			Geometry: plane, cube, sphere, torus, 3D text and more; modifiers: lathe, extrude and tube

			Data loaders: binary, image, JSON and scene

			Utilities: full set of time and 3D math functions including frustum, matrix, quaternion, UVs and more

			Export and import: utilities to create Three.js-compatible JSON 

			Files from within: Blender, openCTM, FBX, Max, and OBJ

			Support: API documentation is under construction, public forum and wiki in full operation

			Examples: Over 150 files of coding examples plus fonts, models, textures, sounds and other support files

			Debugging: Stats.js, WebGL Inspector, Three.js Inspector

			Runs in all browsers supported by WebGL.

		Physics brings an easy-to use interface to three.js.
		Easy for graphics newbies to get into 3D programming. 
		Makes physics simulations easy to run. 

									-Features-

				Support for multiple object shapes, including convex objects and heightfields.
				
				Material system provides simple control over friction and restitution ("bounciness")
				
				Integrated collision detection and events
				
				Compound objects using three.js's hierarchy system 
			
				Full constraint system including Point, Hinge, Degree of Freedom, and more
				
				Vehicle systems
				
				Rotations using either euler or quaternion systems - your preference
				
				Built on top of three.js to keep same convention and coding style


		The Three.js library is being used for a wide variety of applications and purposes including:

			Mixed Media

			Model Visualization and Scene Creation Applications

			Game and Simulation Authoring Tools

			Education


	2. How do you use it? 
	  
	  About: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki

	  Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.Three.js uses WebGL. 

	  Physijs is built on top of ammo.js and runs the physics simulation in a separate thread (via web worker) to avoid impacting the application's performance and taking up 3D rendering time. Apart from updating an object's position, all of the normal three.js conventions remain the same.


	3. Is there a "cheatsheet" you found or made that others can reference?
